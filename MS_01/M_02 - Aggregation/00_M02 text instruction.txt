In This Module, You'll Be Introduced To The Robust Aggregation Framework In MongoDB. Gain An Understanding Of How This Framework Empowers Advanced Data Processing And Manipulation, Providing A Flexible And Efficient Approach To Data Analysis Within MongoDB.



What Will You Learn From This Module?



0) Introduction Of A Powerful Aggregation Framework: Dive Into The World Of Data Manipulation With The Powerful Aggregation Framework. We'll Explore How It Allows You To Process, Group, And Summarize Data From Your MongoDB Collections.



1) $Match , $Project Aggregation Stage: Dive Into The $Match And $Project Aggregation Stages. Learn How $Match Filters Documents Based On Specified Criteria, While $Project Enables Reshaping By Including Or Excluding Fields.



2) $AddFields , $Out , $Merge Aggregation Stage:Explore The $AddFields, $Out, And $Merge Aggregation Stages. Understand How To Add New Fields, Write Results To A New Collection Overwrite An Existing One, And Merge Results Into An Existing Collection.



3) $Group , $Sum , $Push Aggregation Stage: Delve Into The $Group Aggregation Stage, Allowing Grouping By A Specified Key. Learn To Use $Sum To Calculate The Sum Within A Group And $Push To Create Arrays Of Values.



4) Explore More About $Group & $Project: Further, Explore The Capabilities Of $Group And $Project Aggregation Stages. Understand Advanced Techniques In Grouping And Reshaping Data For Specific Analysis Requirements.



5) Explore $Group With $Unwind Aggregation Stage: Discover The $Group Aggregation Stage Combined With $Unwind. Learn How To Handle Arrays Within Documents, Facilitating More Complex Aggregations.



6) $Bucket, $Sort, And $Limit Aggregation Stage: Explore The $Bucket Aggregation Stage For Categorizing Data, $Sort For Sorting Results, And $Limit For Limiting Document Output.



7) $Facet, Multiple Pipeline Aggregation Stage: Dive Into The $Facet Aggregation Stage, Enabling The Execution Of Multiple Pipelines Within A Single Stage. Understand How This Feature Facilitates Parallel Processing Of Various Aggregations.



8) $Lookup Stage, Embedding Vs Referencing:Explore The $Lookup Aggregation Stage For Performing Left Outer Joins Between Collections. Understand The Concepts Of Embedding And Referencing For Efficient Data Modeling.



9) What Is Indexing, COLLSCAN Vs IXSCAN: Learn About Indexing In MongoDB, Its Importance In Optimizing Query Performance, And The Distinction Between COLLSCAN (Collection Scan) And IXSCAN (Index Scan).



10) Explore Compound Index And Text Index: Delve Into Compound Indexes, Involving Multiple Fields, And Text Indexes Designed For Efficient Text Searching. Understand How These Indexes Enhance Query Efficiency.
